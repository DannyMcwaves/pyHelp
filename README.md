# notes

this is just a simple introduction to the notes package.
the notes module, is just a simple package that is supposed to relieve people of the
stress of creating README *.md *.txt or getting help on a specific module by utilising
the doc strings provided in any module. the docstrings could be the main docstrings on the
start of a document in a class or a function.

**  DOCSTRINGS START AND END WITH THREE COMMA'S AS SO.
    """
       any help on a particular object you are trying hard to write
       should be in this enclosed string. every pythonista knows how
       to write docs.
    """ **

first of all there are two modules.
    -Notes
    -iHelp

# Notes
> USAGE of Notes:
>    from notes import Notes, iHelp


>    NB: the module you are going to use is supposed to expose a set of api's (functions and classes and the all variable)
>       ie. __all__ = ["class", "anotherClass", "function1", "function2"]
>        the order in which you display them is the order in which the docstrings will be generated.

>    These are the two constants you need to pass to the Notes Object. You don't have to pass anything else.
>    but make sure all is defined so as to create help for it.

'''python
    notes = Notes(globals(), __all__)
    # call the notes and pass the constants to it

    docs = notes() **
    # call notes to get the docs on all the passed api's. (1)

    print(docs)
    # docs is the full docs on the modules you passed (2)

    notes(print)
    # Is the same as the lines (1) and (2)
    # You can pass and callback function that will operate on the docs.

    notes += "any other thing you are willing to add to the docstring before you operate on it".
    # you can edit the docs on the go and then add more to it

    notes.save(name)
    # This is the one that save the docs to a file. if no, name is provided,
    # It uses README.txt

'''

#iHelp
* this class work with classes and accepts classes as the arguments passed. *

'''python
h = iHelp(class)
# prints the docs on a class to the screen.

h['method']
# get the docstring on a particular method of a class.
